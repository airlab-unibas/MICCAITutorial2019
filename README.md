# Autograd Image Registration Laboratory

A myriad of medical image analysis tasks rely on image registration as a "preprocessing" on which the target model builds on. The development and implementation of such image registration algorithms have been tedious so far and often requires specific programming skills such as parallel computing with CUDA at a low abstraction level.
In this tutorial, the novel image registration framework: Autograd Image Registration Laboratory (AirLab) will be introduced. AirLab is a modern framework for image registration which allows rapid-prototyping for image registration algorithms. It is written in Python and utilizes the autograd functionality of PyTorch in order to exempt the developer from providing explicit gradients. The hands-on tutorial will be for beginners and intermediate-level students, experienced researchers and industry delegates. Participants will learn the principles of AirLab, how AirLab can be integrated into a project and how AirLab can be used in their daily research.
